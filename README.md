To install and set up Angular, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Install Node.js and npm**: Angular requires Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) to be installed on your system. You can download and install them from the official Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

2. **Install Angular CLI (Command Line Interface)**: Angular CLI is a command-line tool used for initializing, developing, scaffolding, and maintaining Angular applications. You can install Angular CLI globally using npm by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

    ```
    npm install -g @angular/cli
    ```

3. **Create a new Angular project**: Once Angular CLI is installed, you can create a new Angular project using the `ng new` command followed by the name of your project. For example:

    ```
    ng new my-angular-app
    ```

    This command will generate a new Angular project with the name `my-angular-app` in the current directory.

4. **Navigate to your project directory**: After creating a new Angular project, navigate into your project directory using the `cd` command:

    ```
    cd my-angular-app
    ```

5. **Serve your application**: To serve your Angular application locally for development, you can use the `ng serve` command. This command builds the application, starts the development server, and watches for file changes. Run the following command:

    ```
    ng serve
    ```

    By default, the Angular application will be served on `http://localhost:4200/`.

6. **Open your browser**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` (or whichever port your Angular application is served on) to see your Angular application running.

That's it! You've now installed and set up Angular on your system, created a new Angular project, and served your application locally for development. You can now start building your Angular application by modifying the files in the project directory.
